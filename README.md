React Native Design #1: Flexbox

Shout out to Kuiper Collective! I’m learning the basics of React-Native from him as well as other sites like MDN and other sources for research!

Flexbox is a simple CSS styling for react-native. Its kind of like Bootstrap in web styling.. We can control the way our app looks by nesting containers within each other and adjusting its shape, and the alignment of its contents! It really helps to separate 
the look of the app into to small chunks that way it makes it easier to move things around and put them where they need to be.
